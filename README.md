# image_stitching

Suppose you are in a small class with your college friends and you want to take a selfie but your camera lens cannot cover everybody, what would you do in this case without changing the camera? The answer is PANORAMA image stitching. It can help you to take overlapping pictures and then stitch them together to make a picture that can cover a wider area. As another example, let’s say you are in Grand Canyon and you’d like to take a picture that is able to show the same view as the one your eyes are able to catch. This is the same technique that Google uses to make its map. If you go to maps.google.com and change the view option into land view you are able to see a wide view of your desired area. 
This was a good motivation for us to start doing this project. By having multiple pictures from the same panoramic view but different angles how it is possible to make one picture capable of representing all of them. Also, it should be taken into account that the pictures of the same panorama has overlapping parts that enable us to extract the common space between two consecutive picture and stitch them together. In other words as it can be seen from the following pictures, the pictures have overlapping parts which is the key in our analysis in order to stitch them to each other.
